# Ruby on Mac Issue Tracker

This is where customers can report bugs and submit feature requests for Ruby on Mac.

**Please note the issue tracker is only for issues with the script.**

If you have questions about Jekyll, Rails, or issues you're running into after the script successfully set up your Ruby development environment, we recommend joining the Ruby on Mac private community and asking your questions there.

Note that the community is only available to people who bought the Prime version of Ruby on Mac.
