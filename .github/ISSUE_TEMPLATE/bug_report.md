Hi there. Thanks for buying Ruby on Mac!

If you bought Ruby on Mac Basic and it failed the first time, please 
read through the troubleshooting guide first before reporting a bug.

If you bought Ruby on Mac Prime or Pro and it failed while running in normal mode, please run it in reset mode first before reporting a bug.

**In which version of Ruby on Mac did you find the bug?**
Basic, Prime, or Pro?

**Describe the bug**
A clear and concise description of what the bug is.

**Details about your Mac**
Before you ran the script for the first time, did you already have development tools like Homebrew installed, or did you run it on a fresh and clean macOS?

**Please attach the Ruby on Mac log file**
The log file will be called either `rom-basic.log`, `rom-prime.log`, or `rom-pro.log`. You can find it in your Mac's Home folder.
